### Two-terminal DC Lines

"""
    $TYPEDEF

The two-terminal DC transmission line model is used to simulate either a point-to-point
system with rectifier and inverter separated by a bipolar or mono-polar transmission system
or a Back-to-Back system where the rectifier and inverter are physically located at the same
site and separated only by a short bus-bar.

The data requirements fall into three groups:
* Control parameters and set-points
* Converter transformers
* The DC line characteristics

The steady-state model comprising this data enables not only power flow analysis but also
establishes the initial steady-state for dynamic analysis.

    Network

Representation of a power network.

The PSS/E data format comprises 16 data categories of network and equipment
elements, each of which requires a particular type of data.

Similarly, a `Network` stores the data from each category in its own dedicated structure.

Currently supported are:
1. [`CaseID`](@ref)
1. [`Buses`](@ref)
1. [`Loads`](@ref)
1. [`Generators`](@ref)
1. [`Branches`](@ref)
1. [`Transformers`](@ref)
1. [`AreaInterchanges`](@ref)
1. [`TwoTerminalDCLines`](@ref)

`CaseID` data is a single row (in the Tables.jl-sense).
You can access it like `network.caseid` and interact with it like a `NamedTuple`,
or even convert it to a `NamedTuple` with `NamedTuple(caseid)`.

All other records (buses, loads, etc.) can be accessed also via the fields, for example
`network.buses`, and each is returned as lightweight table structure (again, in the Tables.jl-sense).
That is, all structures implement the Tables.jl interface, so can be passed to any valid
sink, such as a `DataFrame` like `DataFrame(network.buses)`.

For more info on working with tables see [Tables.jl](https://tables.juliadata.org/), and for
common table operations see [TableOperations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/TableOperations.jl).
