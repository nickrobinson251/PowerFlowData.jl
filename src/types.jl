Each AC transformer to be represented in PSS/E is introduced through transformer data records
that specify all the data required to model transformers in power flow calculations, with
one exception.

That exception is a set of ancillary data, comprising transformer impedance correction records,
which define the manner in which transformer impedance changes as off-nominal turns ratio or
phase shift angle is adjusted. Those data records are described in Transformer Impedance
Correction Records, [`ImpedanceCorrections`](@ref).

Both two-winding and three-winding transformers are specified in the transformer data records.
The data records for the two-winding transformer are common to the three-winding transformer;

Transformer impedance corrections are used to model a change of transformer impedance
as off-nominal turns ratio or phase shift angle is adjusted.

The ``T_i`` values on a transformer impedance correction record must all be either tap
ratios or phase shift angles. They must be entered in strictly ascending order;
i.e. for each ``i``, ``T_{i+1} > T_i``. Each ``F_i`` entered must be greater than zero.

On each record, at least 2 pairs of values must be specified and up to 11 may be entered.

The ``T_i`` values that are a function of tap ratio (rather than phase shift angle)
are in units of the controlling winding’s off-nominal turns ratio in pu of the controlling
winding’s bus base voltage.

Although a transformer winding is assigned to an impedance correction record, each record may
be shared among many transformer windings. If the first ``T`` in a record is less than 0.5 or
the last ``T`` entered is greater than 1.5, ``T`` is assumed to be the phase shift angle and
the impedance of each transformer winding assigned to the record is treated as a function of
phase shift angle. Otherwise, the impedances of the transformer windings assigned to the record
are made sensitive to off-nominal turns ratio.

PSS/E allows the representation of up to 12 converter stations on one multi-terminal DC line.
Further, it allows the modelling of multi-terminal networks of up to 20 buses including the
AC convertor buses and the DC network buses.

## Notes

The following are notes on multi-terminal links:
* Conventional two-terminal and multi-terminal DC lines are stored separately.
  Therefore, there may simultaneously exist, for example, a two-terminal DC line identified
  as DC line number 1 along with a multi-terminal line numbered 1.
* Multi-terminal lines should have at least three converter terminals;
  conventional DC lines consisting of two terminals should be modeled as two-terminal lines
  (see [`TwoTerminalDCLines`](@ref).
* AC converter buses may be type one, two, or three buses. Generators, loads, fixed and
  switched shunt elements, other DC line converters, and FACTS device sending ends are
  permitted at converter buses.
* Each multi-terminal DC line is treated as a subnetwork of DC buses and DC links connecting
  its AC converter buses. For each multi-terminal DC line, the DC buses must be numbered 1
  through `ndcbs`.
* Each AC converter bus must be specified as `ib` on exactly one DC bus record; there may be
  DC buses connected only to other DC buses by DC links but not to any AC converter bus.
* AC converter bus `ib` may be connected to a DC bus `idc`, which is connected directly to ground.
  `ib` is specified on the DC bus record for DC bus `idc`; the `idc2` field is specified as zero.
* Alternatively, AC converter bus `ib` may be connected to two DC buses `idc` and `idc2`,
  the second of which is connected to ground through a specified resistance.
  `ib` and `idc2` are specified on the DC bus record for DC bus `idc`;
  on the DC bus record for bus `idc2`, the AC converter bus and second DC bus fields
  (`ib` and `idc2`, respectively) must be specified as zero and the grounding resistance is
  specified as `rgrnd`.
* The same DC bus may be specified as the second DC bus for more than one AC converter bus.
* All DC buses within a multi-terminal DC line must be reachable from any other point within the subnetwork.
* The area number assigned to DC buses and the metered end designation of DC links are used in
  calculating area interchange and assigning losses as well as in the interchange control option
  of the power flow solution activities. Similarly, the zone assignment and metered end specification
  are used in Zonal reporting activities.

### MultiSectionLineGroups
###

"""
    $TYPEDEF

Multi-section line groups.

Transmission lines commonly have a series of sections with varying physical structures.
The section might have different tower configurations, conductor types and bundles or various
combinations of these. The physical differences can result in the sections having different
resistance, reactance and charging.

A transmission line with several distinct sections can be represented as one
multi-section line group.

The DUM_i values on each record define the branches connecting bus `i` to bus `j`, and
are entered so as to trace the path from bus `i` to bus `j`.

## Example

For a multi-section line grouping consisting of three line sections (and hence two dummy buses):

| From | To | Circuit |
|------|----|---------|
|    I | D1 |      C1 |
|   D1 | D2 |      C2 |
|   D2 |  J |      C3 |

If this multi-section line grouping is to be assigned the line identifier `id` "&1",
the corresponding multi-section line grouping data record is given by:
```
I, J, '&1', D1, D2
```

## Notes

The following notes apply to multi-section line groups:
* Up to 10 line sections (and hence 9 dummy buses) may be defined in each multi-section line grouping.
  A branch may be a line section of at most one multi-section line grouping.
* Each dummy bus must have exactly two branches connected to it,
  both of which must be members of the same multi-section line grouping.
  A multi-section line dummy bus may not be a converter bus of a DC transmission line.
  A FACTS control device may not be connected to a multi-section line dummy bus.
* The status of line sections and type codes of dummy buses are set such that the multi-section
  line is treated as a single entity with regards to its service status.

### Network

"""
    $TYPEDEF

Representation of a power network.

The PSS/E data format comprises 16 data categories of network and equipment
elements, each of which requires a particular type of data.

Similarly, a `Network` stores the data from each category in its own dedicated structure.

Currently supported are:
1. [`CaseID`](@ref)
1. [`Buses`](@ref)
1. [`Loads`](@ref)
1. [`FixedShunts`](@ref)
1. [`Generators`](@ref)
1. [`Branches`](@ref)
1. [`Transformers`](@ref)
1. [`AreaInterchanges`](@ref)
1. [`TwoTerminalDCLines`](@ref)
1. [`VSCDCLines`](@ref)
1. [`SwitchedShunts`](@ref)
1. [`ImpedanceCorrections`](@ref)
1. [`MultiTerminalDCLines`](@ref)
1. [`MultiSectionLineGroups`](@ref)
1. [`Zones`](@ref)
1. [`InterAreaTransfers`](@ref)
1. [`Owners`](@ref)
1. [`FACTSDevices`](@ref)

`CaseID` data is a single row (in the Tables.jl-sense).
You can access it like `network.caseid` and interact with it like a `NamedTuple`,
or even convert it to a `NamedTuple` with `NamedTuple(caseid)`.

All other records (buses, loads, etc.) can be accessed also via the fields, for example
`network.buses`, and each is returned as lightweight table structure (again, in the Tables.jl-sense).
That is, all structures implement the Tables.jl interface, so can be passed to any valid
sink, such as a `DataFrame` like `DataFrame(network.buses)`.

For more info on working with tables see [Tables.jl](https://tables.juliadata.org/), and for
common table operations see [TableOperations.jl](https://github.com/JuliaData/TableOperations.jl).
