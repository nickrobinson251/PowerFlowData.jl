Therefore, there may simultaneously exist, for example, a two-terminal DC line identified as DC line number 1 along with a multi-terminal line numbered 1.\nMulti-terminal lines should have at least three converter terminals; conventional DC lines consisting of two terminals should be modeled as two-terminal lines (see TwoTerminalDCLines.\nAC converter buses may be type one, two, or three buses.
